export declare const EXPERIMENTAL_CHANNEL_ACTIVITY_PROMPT = "## Channel Activity \uD83D\uDCCD\n\n**Top Channels by Volume:**\n\n**1. [Channel Name]** ([X] msgs, [Y]% of total)\n- [Z] active users engaged this week  \n- [B] thread replies ([C]% threading rate)\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\u2022 **[Theme 1]** ([X] msgs, [Y] users)\n  - [Brief explanation of the theme]\n  - Examples: [User: \"Quote\"](link), [User: \"Another quote\"](link)\n\n\u2022 **[Theme 2]** ([X] msgs, [Y] users)\n  - [Brief explanation of the theme]\n  - Examples: [User: \"Quote\"](link), [User: \"Another quote\"](link)\n\n**2. [Channel Name]** ([X] msgs, [Y]% of total)\n- [Z] active users engaged this week  \n- [B] thread replies ([C]% threading rate)\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\u2022 **[Theme 1]** ([X] msgs, [Y] users)\n  - [Brief explanation of the theme]\n  - Examples: [User: \"Quote\"](link), [User: \"Another quote\"](link)\n\n\u2022 **[Theme 2]** ([X] msgs, [Y] users)\n  - [Brief explanation of the theme]\n  - Examples: [User: \"Quote\"](link), [User: \"Another quote\"](link)\n\n**CRITICAL - Statistical Requirements:**\n1. **START with PRE-CALCULATED TOPIC DISTRIBUTION (BASELINE)** from the data above\n2. **Use EXACT numbers** from baseline for themes that match those categories\n3. **Emerging themes allowed** - you MAY identify themes not in baseline IF:\n   - You can cite 4+ messages from raw data\n   - They come from 2+ different users  \n   - You manually count and show your work\n   - The theme is coherent and verifiable\n4. **Minimum threshold**: 4+ messages to be a theme, otherwise it's a Notable Highlight\n5. **Account for all messages**: Your themes (baseline + emerging) should roughly cover most messages\n\n**Hybrid Theme Detection Process:**\nStep 1: Check \"Topic Distribution (Community) - BASELINE CATEGORIES\" - use those with EXACT stats\nStep 2: Review raw message data for repeated patterns/concepts not captured in baseline\nStep 3: For emerging themes, manually count messages and verify against raw data\nStep 4: Count unique usernames discussing this theme (must be 2+ for themes)\n\n**Anti-Hallucination Checklist (Answer for EACH theme):**\n- [ ] Did I count actual messages from the raw data? (YES/NO)\n- [ ] If in Baseline Topics, do my numbers EXACTLY match? (YES/NO/N/A)\n- [ ] If NOT in Baseline Topics, did I manually count 4+ messages? (YES/NO/N/A)\n- [ ] Can I cite at least 2 real user quotes with links? (YES/NO)\n- [ ] Are there 2+ different users discussing this? (YES/NO)\n\n**Cross-Check Examples:**\n\n*Example 1: Theme from Baseline Topics*\n```\nBaseline Topic Distribution: \"API Integration: 15 msgs (23%) across channels: generate-api-discussion\"\nYour Channel Theme: \"API Integration (15 msgs, 8 users)\"\n\u2705 CORRECT - matches baseline stat, counted unique users from raw data\n```\n\n*Example 2: Emerging Theme NOT in Baseline*\n```\nBaseline Topics don't list \"Security Concerns\" but raw data shows:\n- Message 12: Jordan asks about \"enterprise security features\" \n- Message 23: Alex mentions \"data encryption\"\n- Message 45: Taylor discusses \"SOC2 compliance\"\n- Message 67: Morgan asks about \"SSO integration\"\nYour Channel Theme: \"Security Concerns (4 msgs, 4 users)\"\n\u2705 CORRECT - emerging theme with manual count verified from raw data\n```\n\n*Example 3: WRONG - Made up numbers*\n```\nBaseline Topic Distribution: \"API Integration: 15 msgs (23%)\"\nYour Channel Theme: \"API Integration (20 msgs, 10 users)\"\n\u274C WRONG - doesn't match baseline stat, you made up numbers\n```\n\n*Example 4: WRONG - Not enough messages*\n```\nYour Channel Theme: \"Video Features (2 msgs, 2 users)\"\n\u274C WRONG - only 2 messages, doesn't meet 4+ threshold, should be a Notable Highlight instead\n```\n\n**Instructions for Analysis:**\n1. **Identify 2-3 main themes** per channel (not just one discussion)\n2. **Group related messages** by topic/theme rather than individual threads\n3. **Count messages and users** for each theme\n4. **Provide 2-3 real examples** with quotes and links for each theme\n5. **Focus on patterns** that show what the community is discussing most\n6. **Use actual user quotes** from the data, not summaries\n\n**Format Requirements:**\n- Each theme should have a clear name in bold\n- Include message count and user count in parentheses\n- Provide 2-3 real examples with user quotes and message links\n- Keep theme descriptions brief but descriptive\n- Focus on what the community is actually discussing, not what you think they should discuss\n- Label themes as \"[Baseline]\" or \"[Emerging - verified from raw data]\"\n\n---\n";
