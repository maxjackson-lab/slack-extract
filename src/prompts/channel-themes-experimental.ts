2. **Group related messages** by topic/theme rather than individual threads
3. **Count messages and users** for each theme
4. **Provide 2-3 real examples** with quotes and links for each theme
5. **Focus on patterns** that show what the community is discussing most
6. **Use actual user quotes** from the data, not summaries

**Example Theme Categories:**
- Feature Requests, Bug Reports, API Integration, Pricing/Credits, General Discussion, Template/Themes, etc.

**Format Requirements:**
- Each theme should have a clear name in bold
- Include message count and user count in parentheses
- Provide 2-3 real examples with user quotes and message links
- Keep theme descriptions brief but descriptive
- Focus on what the community is actually discussing, not what you think they should discuss
