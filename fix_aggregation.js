**Feature Wishlist**
- **Change Checklist for Agent:** "It would be great to get a checklist of changes agent made so I can uncheck the items I don't want." - Mariena Quintanilla, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C04702QJ39N/p1759263935363469?thread_ts=1759263935.363469&cid=C04702QJ39N)
- **Undo Functionality:** "like an undo function with the exit action taken by buddy but the ability to delete something 10 steps back." - Dr. Deepak Bhootra, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C04702QJ39N/p1759269106214879?thread_ts=1759263935.363469&cid=C04702QJ39N)

**Friction Points**

- **Confusion Over Credit Charges:** "I notice that, unlike when you are creating cards or changing images at the card level, there is no clarity in using the AGENT about how many credits you are going to be charged BEFORE you go forward." - Staci Clarke, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759396606891899?thread_ts=1759396606.891899&cid=C05BT88C8JF)
