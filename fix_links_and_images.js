## What's Resonating ðŸŽ¯

**API Integration Success**
- **Real Estate CRM Integration:** "I have a Real Estate CRM that contains property information and listing information - I am taking that data and generate Gamma presentation using the API." - Mark Stepp, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C08SC8025PT/p1759351442078979?thread_ts=1759351442.078979&cid=C08SC8025PT)
- **n8n Automation:** "I just released a custom Gamma node for n8n (if your self hosting). Most likely by next week it will be in the cloud version." - Chowderr Miller, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C08SC8025PT/p1759510061268609?thread_ts=1759510061.268609&cid=C08SC8025PT)
- **API Improvements:** "Big changes for our API users today: 50 presentations per hour - that's right, we've moved from daily to hourly limits!" - Max J (Gamma API Support Engineer), [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C08SC8025PT/p1759351442078979?thread_ts=1759351442.078979&cid=C08SC8025PT)

## What's Challenging ðŸ˜“

**Agent Reliability Issues**
- **Smart Diagram Problems:** "agent bug. i had a card with a smart diagram (puzzle). prompt \\\`update the titles / primary headings on all cards to use font size \\"Display\\"\\\` the modifications results in the smart diagram breaking." - Mariena Quintanilla, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759174802036309?thread_ts=1759174802.036309&cid=C05BT88C8JF)
- **Setting Reversions:** "I'm not sure what's triggering it yet but, I keep setting header & footer off on a couple of cards in my deck where I have full card images and it keeps getting reverted." - Mariena Quintanilla, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759213625192859?thread_ts=1759213625.192859&cid=C05BT88C8JF)
- **Image Storage Issues:** "There seems to be a glitch in the behaviour of the AGENT and the images that are saved." - Staci Clarke, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759396606891899?thread_ts=1759396606.891899&cid=C05BT88C8JF)

**Pricing Transparency Concerns**
- **Credit Clarity:** "I notice that, unlike when you are creating cards or changing images at the card level, there is no clarity in using the AGENT about how many credits you are going to be charged BEFORE you go forward." - Staci Clarke, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759396606891899?thread_ts=1759396606.891899&cid=C05BT88C8JF)
- **Gallery Access:** "Is frustrating not to have access to the items in the gallery." - Staci Clarke, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C05BT88C8JF/p1759439674784999?thread_ts=1759396606.891899&cid=C05BT88C8JF)

**Feature Requests (6 messages)**
- **Agent Accountability:** "It would be great to get a checklist of changes agent made so I can uncheck the items I don't want." - Mariena Quintanilla, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C04702QJ39N/p1759263935363469?thread_ts=1759263935.363469&cid=C04702QJ39N)
- **Undo Functionality:** "like an undo function with the exit action taken by buddy but the ability to delete something 10 steps back." - Dr. Deepak Bhootra, [link](https://gambassadors.slack.com/archives/C04702QJ39N/p1759269106214879?thread_ts=1759263935.363469&cid=C04702QJ39N)
